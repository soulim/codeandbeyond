# Code && Beyond

Code && Beyond is a weekly podcast with Pablo and Alex, two software engineers
with more than 35 years of professional experience combined. We talk about
creativity, productivity, problem solving, tools, culture, and anything beyond,
but still related to the daily life of a software developer.

This is the official website of the podcast.
