Alex share how they organize their notes and which note-taking tools they use.
From Evernote and Microsoft OneNote to plain-text files in Markdown format,
Obsidian, and more.

  local folder of plain text Markdown files.
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is a all-in-one workspace.
- [Bring!](https://www.getbring.com/) The simplest shopping list for sharing.

  OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app)
