Hello again! It's been a while since we released an episode. But, after a
summer break, we are back on track with new ideas.
<!--more-->

Speaking of breaks, in this episode of Code && Beyond we talk about what we
like to do after work to relax and recharge our batteries. What works for us
and why.

Listen to Pablo talk about mantrailing (training dogs to search for people) and
why he likes tending to the trees in his garden more than growing tomatoes.
Alex, on the other hand, shares why he loves writing software for fun, after
writing software at work.
