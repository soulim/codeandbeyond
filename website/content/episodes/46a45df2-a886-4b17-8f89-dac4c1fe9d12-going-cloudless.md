Cloud-based software has been a part of our lives for quite some time. So much
so, that even some products that currently exist might not have been possible
without it. Besides obvious things like apps on our laptops, smartphones and
PCs, there are cloud-connected TVs, refrigerators, keyboards and many other
gadgets.

While cloud-based software definitely provides many great benefits to consumers
and developers, it comes at a cost that goes beyond its price tag. For
consumers, there are questions about privacy and personal information, freedom
of choice, necessity to be always connected. For developers, it might mean
increased complexity of the things they work on.

In this episode of Code && Beyond, we aren't going to fanatically blame or
defend cloud computing, but try to analyze what works and doesn't work for us
personally, what alternatives we use and why. When would it make sense to go
cloudless?
