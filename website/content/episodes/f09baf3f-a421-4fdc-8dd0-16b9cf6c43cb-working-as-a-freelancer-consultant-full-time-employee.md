As software engineers, we aren't limited to just one type of employment. Some
prefer to have more flexibility and jump from one project to another focusing
on short-term tasks, others value stability and like staying with the company
for a long time. We could work as freelancers, consultants, and, of course,
full-time employees.

have a couple myths around them.

In this episode of Code && Beyond, Pablo and Alex discuss some of the myths and
are trying to prove or bust them using their personal experience.
