Just like Freddie and David say, no man asks for pressure.  There is no denying
that working under pressure with an upcoming deadline in sight is stressful.
However, can it also be useful? Perhaps the stress can help push you forward
towards the finish line of a project? The truth is that there is no one answer,
it all depends on the situation.

In this episode of Code  && Beyond, Pablo and Alex explore different types of
pressure while working in software development projects, including the
accountability that comes from building in public and the relief of getting
rewards for achievements.
